# Survey form with React
This week we were suppose a create a form consisting of three questions and a summary (by using react). 

## The problem
I enjoyed this project though I had several problems throughout the whole process, though I learnt a lot. Since I had several problems getting the right information to be shown in summary, overall css was tricky to me and problems deploying the site on Netlify, I am really happy I finally have a project to hand in.
